# GardenFriends Event Management System

GardenFriends is a web-based platform designed to connect members of a garden community. The system allows users to register their skills, sign up for events, and participate in a variety of gardening-related activities. The project was initially focused on skill swapping but evolved to prioritize event management after community feedback.

## Overview

This project was developed to meet the requirements of Astrid Winterblossom, who wanted a platform where members could host, attend, and participate in various gardening events. The system was designed to handle user registrations, event creation, and management, as well as the roles of event organizers, leaders, and helpers.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration**: Members can sign up with personal details and the skills they are willing to share.
- **Event Categories**: The platform supports three event types: 
  - *Open Gardens* – guided tours of garden features.
  - *Skills and Techniques* – hands-on learning experiences.
  - *Know Your Plants* – focused education on specific plant species.
- **Event Details**: Each event includes information such as title, description, date, location (including postcode), participant instructions, and accessibility information.
- **Volunteer Helpers**: Members can volunteer as helpers for events, providing 1:1 assistance to attendees.
- **Guest Sign-Up**: Events are open to the public, with the option for non-members to sign up with basic contact details.
  
## Database Design

The project includes a well-structured database schema to store user, event, and skill information. Key features of the design:
- Users can register with their personal details and skills.
- Events have organizers, leaders, and helpers with relationships to registered users.
- Events are categorized and include accessibility and location information.
